An undead spirit raised by the will of nature to deal with things that are deemed a threat to the balance of life in the region.

We have met two Duraghs:
One unnamed in [[New Dothulgrad]], who was working with the [[Eldremar Rebellion]] to acquire the [[Valuren Warship]]. 
[[Archdruid Vargoth]] working to defy [[Toth]] from underneath [[Twinslove]]. It is unclear if he was truly a Duragh, or someone simply claiming to be one.
