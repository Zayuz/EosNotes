Wolf's Durge is a small stone building in [[Narthaxxus]]. (Wolfmother statue)
Unsuspecting Cave in the mountain north of Wolf's Durge. There is a stone tower there that overlooks the cave, and the wolfmother will be there. LOUD NOISE, then explain ourselves. Wolfmother has not talked to the pantheon in centuries.

Tim-o-thee and Quendoline want a different post instead of Wolf's Durge. Will pay 1K gold. Just kidding he lost it :(
