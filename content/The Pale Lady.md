After an argument with Lithiel about her having convinced Leanna to walk into battle without protection, Shiloh is brought into an isolated realm of mist and sees a figure in a full white cloak. She has snow white skin, and offers a gift - a scroll. Maybe she's here, maybe Shiloh has been dragged into another realm. Seems not spooky? She calls the scroll 'assistance,' and says that even though he's done well without it he would do better with it. 10th level spell 'eclipse life.' Damage spell that is cast at a target. Charisma save. 'Lusacan is by far the toughest of the foes you've saved, and I mean that literally. It will take more than stabbing, blasting, and shooting to take him down. The divine guardian is a good step, but it is one blade against the sky itself.' 'Do I know you?' 'No, and I would prefer you don't. Not yet anyways. Prove my faith correct and we may have a longer conversation. Call me an interested party.' Malphas claims the spell was stolen from a holy order academy. She mentioned Lightseeker at some point. She first referred to our group as her assistants.
