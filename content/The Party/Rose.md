The sole survivor of the dragon encounter that she fought with [[Shiloh]] and [[Aurian]].
She is considered to be a [[Prophet]] by [[Malphas]].

Rose is supposed to visit [[Inodan]] with [[Tassia]] to meet [[Oris]], who she has felt a strange connection to when visiting her shrine. However, the event [[Tassia#Denied Inodan|Tassia denied Inodan]] transpires and Rose must enter alone for the event [[Rose goes to Inodan]].

Later, when the party explored [[Wolfmotherâ€™s Embrace]], Rose gained an audience with the [[Watchers]] in the following conversation about the nature of the [[High Ones]] and their motives: [[Rose Meets the Watchers]]

When confronting [[Nagasha]], the following transpired:
Rose 'bears his mark.' It will do for breaking the chain. 'No... You bear *her* mark.' 


### Is Rose a Dawnborn?
A theory by Lithiel.

Rose was mentioned to be 'unreadable' by [[Scrimshaw]], who typically can insight any sentient creature.

> "Who are you?" - Scrimshaw
> "Maybe one day you'll find out." - Rose

[[Tassia]] was assigned to work with Rose and [[Shiloh]] for seemingly no reason. Considering that all the [[Dawnborn]] have retreated to the heavens to sit out their rebellion war, this is a huge diversion of one of his most capable assets that makes no sense to [[Lithiel]].

Rose has been taken aside to speak to [[Malphas]] privately during their audience.

She believes Malphas is lying when he claims the method to attain divinity is no longer accessible, and Rose may have done so by firing the beacon.

Shiloh seems to guard Rose, but they are not romantically involved. He even died for her, and then came back to fight for her again.

Malphas checked on [[Oris]], and she is alive and well. But... Apparently Rose is invited to speak with her. Next time in Ark Rose will go to the seat of the pantheon. Not even Tassia has received this honour. "She would be delighted to speak to a kindred soul." Lithiel thinks that Rose will replace [[Cirral]], the Dawnborn that was slain by the [[Eldremar Rebellion]].
