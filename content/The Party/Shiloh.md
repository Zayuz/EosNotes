Died alongside the rest of the party during the [[Battle of Charrum Vale]]. Shiloh was revived by [[Arazeal]].

Shiloh's village in [[Narthaxus]] was set upon by undead when he was young, who slaughtered the populace to the last man. Shiloh remained hidden, and when the [[Deathseekers]] found him they took him in and gave him a new family to be part of.

Because of his efforts in slaying Freyalise's Liutenants, the party was granted Arazeal's [[Rite of the Ancients]]. 
Later, after saving [[Death's Vigil]] from the full might of the undead army, he was promoted to First Deathseeker.
The ritual for his promotion mentioned the following groups/people and associated them with the following traits:
Dawnborn- Merciful
Ancients- Wise
Arazeal- Leader
