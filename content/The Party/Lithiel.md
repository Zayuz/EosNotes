Lithiel has a Spotify playlist representing her psyche, background, and themes all at once. Though the order of songs is not strictly chronological, they are intentional. It can be found [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ikA958hDMZLdA8iGMv4Hj?si=c7045549db264bd5).

An [[Angels|Angel]] ([[Aasimar]]) heroine who's spent as much of her life as possible amassing power entirely on her own in hopes of protecting her homeland of [[Alderwyl]] in the name of mortal-lead civilization inspired by [[King Lysandre]]. 

Lithiel lived below a collapsed mage's tower on the east side of the [[Wraith Wilds]], within a still-intact basement that was activated by her blood. She believed this was because of her magical potential, but the truth is unclear to her. Within this tower she took up residence in the home of an experienced wizard and avid supporter of [[King Lysandre]]. She read his tomes, tried to learn his spells, and came to love Lysandre as an idol. It gave her hope when she had none, a motive for heroism, and now she recognizes all of his enemies as her own. Shame, then, that his enemies included the entire world.

Rather motivated to learn about the evils afflicting her homeland, she studied the [[Incarnates]] of her own volition, collecting intel on them whenever she could in hopes of one day freeing her homeland of them. At some point when she was forced to return home to [[Paradyse]] by circumstance, she found that the [[Cult of the Mirror]] was receptive to working with her. No longer their pawn as she had been as a child, she found that her attempt to disband them by stealing a sacred relic of theirs, a whip, only increased her acceptance of her as a champion of their dark god. In truth, their help was not unwelcome due to the lack of support for her mission to free Alderwyl from the yoke of the undead, Dawnborn and dragons all at once. She came to accept the cult more with time, relying on them for supply and comfort while insisting it does not compromise her heroism.

Lithiel is somewhat uncooperative. She's never operated with others, trained by herself her entire life, and any family she has sooner tried to kill her than help her flourish. Despite this, her presence is rather high. She is driven, capable, and well intentioned and this makes people tend to follow her lead. 

"Seize your birth right" - Razikale to Lithiel upon donning the crown

Lithiel claims to Shiloh early in the campaign that her god is Lysandre, and assures him that her goals of killing undead and ridding the world of Tyrants are the same. Xen mentioned Lithiel has parasite in her that needs to be removed before she can receive power from Xen. Xen also appeared directly and chatted with her, calls Razikale an ingrate and is the deity of indulgence. 

#### Visions
Lithiel sees a year in advance with her violent divination potion... These will be events if we dont alter the world!
Three events:
Lathyrus - Restored and rebuilt with angels and Lithiel on the throne and Freyalise's Crown on (not corrupted) UNTIL a loud sci fi whir and blast goes off. From across the sea a giant pillar of light fires and there's a huge flash EAST.
Ark on fire with shadows rampaging through the streets with armies clashing. Statue of Malphas is a beacon. Holy order vs ???
Evermoon HATCHES ???

### Backstory
There isn’t much for the living in Alderwyl. Nothing but desolation and anarchy, wraiths and monsters, and very occasionally a town that maintains soil and infrastructure enough to grow crops to be turned into the famed brandy of a dead empire. A truly fortuitous place to be born for a young lady, growing up in the village of Paradyse under martial law by the Dawnborn who themselves barely maintain a presence. Better, her single mother was a devotee of Razikale, the Duskborn of Obsession and Sex. She didn’t have any good role-models, and her mother even found her to be blessed by her demonic goddess for the unusual body she was born with as a hermaphrodite. This was a curse, as it made her mother pay more attention to her than she ever wanted, but it was also a blessing in that her mother invested actual skills into her daughter - the only one of six to get her attention. She was taught to read and write, to learn the ways of demons and fight for her proper place as the target of five other envious rivals. 

But the attention of a devotee of the obsession god was, as one can imagine, overwhelming and mentally taxing. Not to mention that her sisters, now maturing, had made an attempt on her life - one that was sure to lead to more. At twelve she abandoned her home and took to the wraith-wilds, a sect of land that tended to be abandoned lest one wished to perform a sacrifice to the undead that lurked the plains, and in the dark and lonely fields of Duskwind she discovered an ancient library many days from her home, preserved beneath the remains of what seemed to be a ruined wizard’s tower. The silence was the best companion she’d ever had, and in his home she found that the wizard’s enchantments still worked. A food conjuration enchantment on the cupboard among other things allowed her to sample the finer elements that existed out there somewhere - a hope for a better life kindling within her. But why did she find this? Why her? She just felt lucky, not like she deserved the comforts her family was denied. And yet, she didn’t return to share her findings. Her contempt for her home wouldn’t allow it. (The suspected truth of the matter is that the tower only appears to those of the ancient King Lysandre’s blood, hence its proper state and status as a safehouse.)

Lithiel was surrounded by books, and by the gods of dawn and dusk she did read. Every tome in the library would be consumed over time, enchanting the mind once concerned only with survival - teaching it the history of her lands, the once people of Lathyrus and the corruption of Razikale and the war with the dragons and the Dawnborn that made these lands the wreckage they still were. Fictional tales and those of King Lysandre filled her with hope - it gave her someone to be when she had nothing to strive for. Everyone in her life was awful, but the people from the legends and the stories were worthy idols - or at least her ideas of them were. She could be someone like Lysandre; a bastion of righteous power that showed all the evils of the world that she could not be toppled. Who saw wickedness in the world and brought light to it, establishing order and peace thereafter. Compiling the spell scrolls in the building into a spellbook of her own and practicing the spells as described in the novels on the arcane, within the year she found herself capable of casting cantrips. It was great progress for a lone child, but it was not enough to slay dragons and wraiths… So she took longer. More novels read, knowledge gleaned, magic trained. Again. Again. Again. One even described the ancient elven art of blade-dancing, which she took to when her mind needed a break. Two more years pass, occasionally traveling out toward another village for socialization and trade - performing magical services for them in exchange for coin when the holy order can’t be bothered to pay attention. She went by Lysandra, taking the name of her role model and the person she tried to act and think like during her exchanges, rather effectively instilling his supposed values of fairness, gregariousness, and honour in the young woman. Not all people deserve her scorn, she now knew. Even the most vile of humans was a product of their environment - and so she had resolved to help make their town’s life better. Slowly she integrates with their society, the town of Parvum, and even manages to make some friends. She resolves disputes and serves as a respected mystic from the cursed lands. This takes another two years, but she considers herself one of them.

Then, one night, she’s attacked on the way to Parvum. Wraiths descend on her, her perfect and studied route compromised by a natural disaster that drove them to make a detour. She fends them off, barely, and retreats home. Grabbing as many things as she can and suddenly forced in the direction she came from so many years ago, Lithiel returns home bloodied and exhausted to evade the enemies that have now taken to her essence. Paradyse is still as miserable as it used to be, but the tragic Lithiel is not welcomed with open arms… Rather, the holy order identifies her as a witch and seeks to exterminate her immediately upon arrival. The burning desperation from the blood pouring down her skin, the stories of heroes faced with impossible odds who triumphed through a strange sense of destiny and rigorous training, the sight of her mother stepping from her old home to see what the commotion was about. It ignites something within her, and her rusted rapier glows a hot white. It burns with divine flame, and wings burst from her back as she charges into the unprepared soldiers, cutting them down and then turning back to the wilds to strike down the wraiths that chased her here to begin with. They’re vanquished, but the girl passes out from her injuries and the stress of whatever this was in short order. 

She awoke exactly where she never wanted to be - her mother’s cult altar. Some villagers and her mother surround her, who thank her for ridding them of the holy order's presence so that they might practice openly. Her mother had waited long for the blessed of Razikale to return, and in her unconscious state she had inscribed her with a rune dedicated to her dark glory - a spiked, stylized heart - under her daughter’s chest. They treat her as a guest, and a very conflicted Lithiel rests and recovers while under their service, her apprehension slowly melting until they try to coax her into their rituals… Deciding that she’d had quite enough and that the cult needed to disband given how sinister Razikale was and the damage she had done to their once great empire, she sneaks into the cult’s deepest chambers and discovers a weapon - a whip - imbued with the very essence of their distant goddess. Demons themselves guard it, but the heroine knows what will satisfy them. She gives them their desire, her body, and proceeds to take the relic with their approval. …And yet, appearing with the holy weapon and demons satisfied through Razikale’s ways, the cult is only more convinced of her place as their champion. A frustrated Lithiel finally relents, accepting her new position and starting a new life in Paradyse as a cult champion for her mother. Her sisters still treat her coldly, but their prior tensions do not burn nearly so bright. About a year passes like this, fighting off any new attempts for the holy order to establish themselves while the hedonistic ways of the cult slowly become normalized to her. Among their teachings is the exaltation of their new champion… This is entertaining, but never shares credit for her position with Fate, nor the possibility of being selected by a deity. She remembers well the hopeless wandering through the wraith wilds as a child, meeting potential death at every turn, and despairing. The conditions that drove her out to begin with were orchestrated by those who came before her and nothing more. Only when she seized her life in her own hands did anything start to get better. …And so, she decides that she needs to go out into the world to help restore Duskwind, wielding her relic, her ancient spells, and her inexplicable wellspring of power that comes from her desire to bring light to her lands of darkness. She begins to rely on and accept Razikale’s cults as places of respite for her, insisting that this doesn’t compromise the heroism of her exploits… 

Sporting wings and holy light during her battles, the people start to call her the ‘Angel of Paradyse’. Her battles are chosen carefully, building her skills and shrinking back from other dangers until she believes herself capable of facing them. Her focus in combat is primarily on defence, keeping herself safe and striking only when the opponent becomes overextended. After all, if the opponent can never hit her, how can they ever hope to kill her?

### Motives
#### Act 2
Wishes to acquire the powers of a Deathseeker of Arazeal - to kill undead permanently. However, she does not wish to join them. She wishes the same for Shadows.
Wishes to find and wield [[King Lysandre's Blade]].

Lithiel has many enemies, most of which have never heard of her at game start. She will act freely against any of the following groups with no motive other than causing as much trouble for them as possible:
S Tier Enemies
Freyalise and Razelighter

A Tier Enemies:
Undead

B Tier Enemies:
Shadows, Incarnates and their Cults

C Tier:
Dawnborn (temporary alliance, hostilities disbanded but re-igniting), Dragons

Lithiel does not consider predatory mortals or criminals to be her foes, so long as they act out of a need to survive the other elements on this list.

#### Act 3
The list from act 2 remains, but Lithiel has now defeated Freyalise and Urthemiel. She has joined the Holy Order and come to have an uneasy acceptance with the party, who regard her sceptically. Some of them believe her evil, and this frustrates Lithiel after how much fighting she's done at their side. Lacking some of her powers since Razikale abandoned her, she now walks the fine line between harnessing ruinous powers to make up for this loss and assuaging the concerns of her allies. Now 'queen' of Lathyrus, Lithiel forfeits this to Ourea to save her image - earning her a new, truly good ally in exchange for the place as heir and princess of her homeland. 

She sincerely wants to grow her power, make her homeland (all of Alderwyl now) beautiful and free of her enemies, and help prevent the end of the world. She wants to respect the relationships she has and their desires while subtly trying to push the envelope.

### Class Composition & Techniques
Lithiel always has Mage Armor active, flavoured as invisible runes she carves into the weave each morning to protect her from harm. They once compounded with her blessing of Razikale to keep her highly warded from harm, but now the [[Armor of Shapes]] applies these runes automatically for her.

Her Blessing of Razikale manifests in two parts. 
The ritual her mother conducted surrounding her birth made her an angel and granted her hermaphroditism.
The acceptance of the [[Cult of the Mirror]] signified through adopting her pact weapon, the whip, granted her Razikale's direct protection in the form of a spiked, stylized heart tattoo hidden below her breasts.

![[Lithiel's Blessing.png| 100x100]]

When she feels the wards she placed around her breaking in combat, she uses magical shielding reinforce them and prevent attacks from breaking the skin she leaves unarmoured.

Angelic Form - Lithiel can sprout wings for a short time each day, a talent she discovered while on the brink of death in Paradyse, where she earned her name (Angel of Paradyse). Since Razikale exited her body, she has found the wings and holy power come to her more permanently.

#### Current Class Composition:

Wizard: Bladesinger
Bladesinging for Lithiel means using a practiced set of steps, movements, simple spells and physical techniques all memorized through daily ritual conducted for the last ten years of her life. All of them amount to her being fluid and dangerous in combat, more so than any other particular element of her kit and classes. Her melee combat features defensive stances, defensive hexes, and and focus on maintaining concentration in combat mirror an old Lathyran tradition that has been entirely eliminated from the world.

Paladin: Autonomy
The Oath of Autonomy binds paladins to protect mortal realms from the enemies of liberty and peace, throwing themselves into active conflicts in the name of preserving a world without fear. Honing their minds, spirits and bodies to be the ultimate weapons against such threats, the paladins seek out and resolve conflicts that disrupt autonomous living through clever thinking, idealistic thought, and tremendous violence.

Paladins who follow the oath of Autonomy do not shy away from conflict, be it ideological or physical. Battle in both ways is a test of ideals, and it is their responsibility to fight for the side they believe is better for the future of Eos regardless of prior allegiance.

*Discipline. You are the shield against the endless terrors that haunt Eos. Train at every opportunity. Your blade must be forever sharp and your mind keen to survive what lies beyond.

*Courage. You must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. If you don't act, then who will? The goal of a better world comes before fear, comfort, and even love.

*Vanity - Aka 'Illumination'. Your body is a temple that ought to be preserved and exalted. Hone it to its full potential, and use it without shame. Let it radiate confidence and beauty that matches the strength of your idealism to give hope to the hopeless.


#### Old Class Composition:
Warlock: Pact of the Blade + Hexblade
Lithiel's Warlock traits manifest in the form of Beguiling Influence and Eyes of the Rune Keeper which allow her to invoke her patron's charm to convince and lie to others, and to read any and all forms of writing respectively.
The Pact of the Blade also grants her a hex she can place on one foe, marking them with the above heart and letting her whip thirst for their blood.

Paladin: Glory
Lithiel's particular oath was never officially taken, but she has allowed it to drive her since the age of 13. Since she allowed the fear in her heart to be replaced by a drive to personally destroy the evils of Alderwyl instead of waiting for other people to save her she has find the power of a paladin called to her side. A strong component of this faith is to see the continent of Alderwyl restored under a mortal ruler, inspired by tales of Lysandre  who was not afraid to do battle with dragons, tyrant gods, and great evils (according to her stories). She firmly and solidly believes that she can and will save Alderwyl without the aid of the Dawnborn, and giving up on this belief that mortals such as herself can drive history and defeat the evils of her homeland successfully will result in a failure to maintain her oath.

She does not know from where she summons the power she does when she smites or uses paladin spells, believing them to be the manifestations of raw conviction meshed with a talent for wizardry and angelic blood. Considering that they eat up her mana pool, this explanation satisfies her.

### Conspiracies
##### Sceptical of Shiloh and Rose's Motives (Debunked)
Lithiel finds Shiloh's unexplained knowledge of the underwater area, and the fact that there is a ritual at all that none of them know about to be suspicious. She does not believe his explanation of 'Deathseeker Senses.'

Shiloh did not simply walk away and deny absorbing the lieutenant's soul, he actively said 'don't let it die near me' With the exact tools and knowledge to get to the end of the dungeon, avoid all split paths, etc, she is convinced that Rose and Shiloh knew EXACTLY where they were going and why. Though... When they got to surface Tassia did not know about the resurrection or facility. She is a bad liar, so Lithiel believes this to be true.

Debunked when they clarified that they were holy order and that they were working with Scrimshaw.

##### Rose is a Dawnborn (Active)
Relocated to [[Rose#Is Rose a Dawnborn?|Rose, The Dawnborn]].

##### Things that Bother Lithiel
Leanna suggested that Lithiel had entirely selfish ambitions and shouldn't be trusted, put a gun to her head
Tassia 'nearly' ordered a hit on Lithiel (Lithiel does not know this), very ominous vibe to her mentioning that to Florian.
Shiloh has made several allusions to fighting Lithiel if things go poorly with her gambits

### Unsorted Session Details
Huge spike full of shadow energy in the heart of Lusacan. Has the same make as the Runestones found in Twinslove and in Progenitor Ruins. 
It makes a funky wunky sound when the Divine Guardian attacks it. Carvings and glyphs in it... It is metal, and super heavy and sharp. When it fell out of Lusacan, he started to fall immediately. 

The landmass Lusacan is flying over is a storm, with glimpses of small humanoids zooming in and out of clouds all over the place with flashes of colored lights. It seems there is a fight going on! Ruins of HUGE ancient roman vibe ruins. Thousands fighting below. The ruins are very old and overgrown, and happens to be elvish in origin. Neither wood elf, nor holy order elf. There are space rifts everywhere like that of Inodan. They are larger, and the flying creatures were angels. They fight angelic mockeries. This is Eresséia. The people were humanoid and they fight thralls like those from Narthaxus. Less ice, more shadow. 

When an incarnate is slain with Oris's magic, they are for real for real killed.
Lusacan is for real for real gone. 
Razikale speaks... 'Ohh that was vicious, even for you.'

Lithiel has realized that being kind and polite will help her make friends.
The white lady appears to Shiloh again... She's like 'what why didn't you use my gift?' She can see our dinners, and believes that Lithiel absorbing the power of the incarnates should trouble Shiloh. He intends to keep an eye on her. She can see Lithiel speaking to Amelia about it... She is interested in us because we are the 'first people in uncountable ages to actually DO SOMETHING. To MAKE PROGRESS. To break the infinite cycle.' She thinks our incarnate slaying is 'pretty sick.' Shiloh is afraid to fragment their momentum and  comraderies if he intervenes against Lithiel. She offers power of her own and claims that this means we have other avenues. Her power is her own, she claims. Carefully curated over aeons. She hates the incarnates. 

Lithiel merged consciousnesses with Urthemiel... And every soul added to hers frays hers a little bit more. 
Her *soul* is merging with them, and souls can be damaged. Scrimshaw told her that every incarnate added consumes a part of her. The incarnates are beholden to Lithiel's will, but their powers are not being restricted in any way. The less Lithiel soul there is, the more their power will leak out. More incarnates = more passive negative effects. Scrimshaw says she is older than the Gods. Scrimshaw gave her a metal rubix-cube like box with no colors. She evaluates this extremely highly. 

Rose's dream: Figure made of Golden light. He walks down the stairs away from her. It is in her house. In the kitchen, with the glowing golden arcane ball. It is not one of the animal high ones, and it waves its hand over the ball and it moves towards Rose. She takes it out of the cup and it is like a control sphere but bigger. Her mother's voice comes from the sphere: you're ready. The sphere shakes. The figure has become feminine. She obtains the ball in her backpack. The figure now has hair. It goes to the garden. There is something in the sky blocking it out - a pure white laminate sky. Esoteric shape? Wings folded all different directions. 7 or so. At the centre is a glowing golden female face. It is Oris.
