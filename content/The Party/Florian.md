Florian's Blade opens a portal to the Shadowhunter's domain ([[Blade Grove]]) via the command "We walk the solemn path this night. We fear no shadows we bring no light."

[[Florian's Father]] was a hero that slew [[Shadow]] across the world, and after dying in battle his son now takes up his legacy. He has 50+ ancestors who have followed this profession before him. NPCs tend to see him as a goofball. He adopted a dragon named [[Roofian]] who is now being cared for in [[Charrum Vale]].

Florian learned that he can travel to the [[Blade Grove]] physically via a dream with his father. Presumably, it is in the lost land of [[Eress√©ia]].
