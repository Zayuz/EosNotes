A firbolg cleric of [[Iara]], chosen as some sort of hero by a conclave of three nature-aligned deities.
Seems devoted to the Dawnborn.
From [[Twinslove]], and long-time friend of [[Florian]].



When we return to our base, a portal opens that Amelia enters. It connects to Iara and Cardos's realm!
Blue flowerbed is where Amelia wakes from, and Iara greets her firsthand. She is once again free to spread her influence around the forest! Amelia is given the title 'Hero of the Wilds.' There is a runestone here, and this place is a mirror of twinslove's woods yet more magical. Arazeal is here, and he says the Dawnborn celebrate their success. The Dawnborn wish to reward her by altering the cycle of Life and Death to return her village to life! The souls that naturally die reach the Sepulchre, instead bound to Toth. Because of this, they can be renewed or restored. Send the souls on their way, or return them to Amelia. Reincarnated as sacred animals. So long as Iara holds power over the forests, they would live this way. They are thus reincarnated! When Iara's magic reaches twinslove, she will reward Amelia with mastery over Life!
