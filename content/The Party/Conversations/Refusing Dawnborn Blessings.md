The subject of an argument between [[Lithiel]] and [[Tassia]], in which Lithiel explains some of her reasons for not accepting their aid. It turns into an argument over the best fate for the continent and mages later on.

Lithiel's points were as follows:
1. The Dawnborn are fallible, but they are not the origin of power. If mortals strive to be worthy of governing themselves without the Dawnborn, we need to prove that we can find and use our own power. Not to rely on handouts for the rest of time. 
2. I cast magic. Under Dawnborn rule, I would be put to death. I have fought them all my life. I have hated them for it, when I had hate to spare. I cannot accept their blade while holding onto that conflict within me.
3. I am your ally as long as Alderwyl is under threat. Under any other circumstance, we would be enemies. As a follower of Lysander's teachings, which is that mortal life should stand independent and fight for their fate on their own terms. I still believe that the men I killed deserved it, and I will not apologize for it. It would make accepting their blessings paradoxical.
4. Without my faith in my own ability to affect the world, and to save Alderwyl, all my training - every day of solitude would have been for nothing. And look what I have achieved! Abandoning this path now, or compromising on these ideals will due more damage to my conviction than the power they would grant me.

Tassia's Points were as follows:
1. The Dawnborn have greatly extended the life of this cleansing. Without them all of humanity would be dead, and they have had every chance in every other cycle to prove themselves and failed. We need what strength the gods can give us.
2. The Dawnborn are generally good and want the same things that Lithiel does, it is foolish to deny herself an ally so clearly aligned on the side of civilization when none other is available.
3. This land was originally Dawnborn owned, and was far better off then when compared to any other period of history.

As things go on, the argument changes focus to Magic and wild mages, where Lithiel demands 'how' Tassia would control her, despite their collective knowledge on what damage uncontrolled magic can do to the world.

Tassia won the argument rather handily, but was put off by the disagreement to the point that she was going to request a new assignment from Malphas. The group soothed her, and she was convinced by Lithiel conceding that even if she won't take the blessings she does believe this is the best way to help her homeland - she would rather the Dawnborn control the land than anyone else on her 'list' and Tassia can always put her down if her magic goes rogue.
