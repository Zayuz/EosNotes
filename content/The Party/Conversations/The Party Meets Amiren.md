Scene featuring [[Amelia]], [[Shiloh]], [[Rose]], [[Florian]], [[Lithiel]], and [[Amiren]]. 

We move into the great light for 30~ mins and find a massive chamber with a stone giant guardian.
This character is [[Amiren]].
She says that giant is 'the language of the old ones.'
Have you come to pay respects to the Luminos?
She has been here since the first breath began.
The Luminos lies beneath and is the size of [[Ark]]. It breathes normally.
What happened to it? 'It fell'
[[Bral]] is the city we found.
When beacons fire the shadows become light, and then disappear. This bird does nearly the same thing to Shadows that enter its light!
This giant is the last of the runecarvers. They made the runestones. 'The Dawnborn picked up the pieces of a broken, dying world.' 'The surface I knew was torn by wore, choked by ash and hate.'
'You are much kinder than the previous mortals to come here. Most fight. Most die.'

[[Amiren]] is the name of the giant guarding the Luminos
Bral was the first city of man, before Dawnborn and such. They fought a war among themselves about how to worship the Luminos which seems to have resulted in their current state. 
Amiran saw the bird fall while gathering. A ball of radiant energy came from nowhere (she imagines it is like the sun), it burst and shook the world to the core. The ball it came from then swirled away into nothingness. Its arrival saved the giants via its light. 'It burned me but for the first time I could truly see.'
[[Amiren]] offered to teach Lithiel her runic magic.
[[Amiren]] got along with ONLY [[Arazeal]], attempting to soothe the souls of Bral.
All life comes from the darkness within [[Kraktanbor's Cauldron]]
There have been at least 100 cycles. 'Each quicker than the last... Except for this one.'
There are ALWAYS a group of survivors to pick up the pieces of a broken cycle. It is calculated and malicious. Those beneath the earth seem to be buffered from the cleansing - only those deep though.
Calls herself a listener. There are other listener enclaves.
The incarnates were the subject of the war she mentioned, in which her people THE NUMEN fought between the elder dark and the listeners. They were once people, but in their insatiable hunger for the light turned into beasts. Over time they became the elder darks, the most power creatures that live in the planes of darkness. When the Luminos fell, some swarmed its body and became addicted to its light as it ate away at them.
