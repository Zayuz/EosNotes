A [[Holy Order]] term for those mages that resist their induction into the order. Due to the sheer presence of the Holy Order in most parts of the world, Wild Mages tend to remain isolated until they are killed by their powers, go mad, or are caught by the order. 

The treatment of [[Wild Mages]] caused an argument between [[Tassia]] and [[Lithiel]] - [[Refusing Dawnborn Blessings]].
