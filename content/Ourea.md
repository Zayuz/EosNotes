Ourea claimed I was her descendent and that I was a demon, she could purge me of my curses but it would probably kill me.

'She didnt leave much to chance'
Ourea has been to Eresséia and fights the high ones there
Eresséia has been taken over by the rifts spawned by the high ones
All of the high ones have corrupted versions of other things (the ice thralls, the angels)
Destroy the artefacts of Razikale, and then give the throne to Ourea.
