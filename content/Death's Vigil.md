The [[Deathseekers|Deathseeker]] sanctum and base on [[Alderwyl]]. Contains a gate to the afterlife, which [[Arazeal]] would need to die in order to seal. 

This means we must defend the base physically against [[Freyalise]] and her wraith army, who attack after we defeated three of her lieutenants. Thus [[Battle of Death's Vigil]] begins.
