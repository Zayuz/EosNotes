Wolfmother's Embrace - settlement made by frost giants to venerate their goddess, now inhabited by humans after they moved on. We understand the crazy changing weather of Narthaxus is something to do with elemental wars according to legend. Occupied by shifters mostly and humans who do not remember the holy order fondly. Their native beasts of burden are called Gurem - a mix of dinosaur, polar bear, and ox. They are humongous. Sometimes they even place their settlements above two of them bound closely. Docile when well fed, very dangerous when enraged.

Huge ice pillar in this city contains something? But it is a remnant of a war between the giants and something dark from the era of dusk. Likely an enemy encased in ice, and there are many of them around in the mountain range, but not in the city.

The statue is the tower. The last prophet to visit was 'put on a spike'

Amelia and Lithiel threw a tree for a big big (holy) pupper

Mountain looks like it was split in two at a ravine

The structure here in the ravine is one of the greatest megastructures in the world! Similar in scope to the sun temple. Large ice things along the way. Two bridges, where one is engulfed in this and the other is clean. The giant pillar of jagged ice on the other bridge has a monster within that is not fully trapped due to the chaotic construction of its ice prison. Huge freaky guy. They're not shadows... They may be from a prior cycle given they fought with the giants. Some of them are smaller, and appear similar to the larger ones. The shaman calls them Thralls.

We met a blind oracle who lead us inside, she had a really big headdress. The people here found texts within, runes carved into stone that spoke of beings from beyond the stars and ancient prophecies. Creatures from the deepest abyss. 

Shaman says rose is interesting for ignoring the advice of her masters. Why does she guard this place? She is the only one who could. Why do the Dawnborn not stay in Narthaxxus? This place is a disease, and the weather is a symptom. She is 'but a humble guide.' 
When was the last time you brought anyone down here? Three or four months ago. (Maybe the one they impaled?)
