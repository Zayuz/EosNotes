The grandmother of [[Leanna]] and the greatest [[Deathseekers|Deathseeker]] to have served under [[Arazeal]], she had [[Lusacan]] as her companion and friend and kept the company of [[King Lysandre]] before they fell to corruption through the [[Rage of Dragons]] and the Fall of [[Lathyrus]]. She was also friendly with [[Ourea]].


#### Memories
Shiloh must collect the four pieces of Reihan's soul - sundered upon her death by Lusacan - to unlock his skill tree.

The Eerie is a massive tower that the wish restored, and is where the angels used to stay. It has a sky jail like the one in game of thrones. Time slow effect? Ghosts of Reihan (katana), Lysandre, and a red scaled dragonborn with a mane of fur down his back in a big cloak. They overlook Lathyrus, it is thriving. There be people and friendly dragons everywhere. 
Dragonborn: 'its a shame, I half expected this to be a fun reunion'
Rei: 'Yes, well... At least we have each other.'
Lysandre: 'Well, if this is to be our last meeting for the foreseeable future lets make the most of it. Who wants to go sky racing?'
They agree and dragonborn becomes a huge dragon (size - ancient+)
Lysandre sprouts angel wings (aasimar), and Reihan's sword etching of a Pegasus becomes a mount for her to fly.
