The first and last monarch of [[Lathyrus]], an independent kingdom that escaped the yoke of the [[Dawnborn]]. He was friends with [[Reihan]] and [[Lusacan]], and married to [[Ourea]].

He notes in his journal, after going on a picnic with his two friends the following: 'That Malphas guy sure is  a piece of work, huh?'

He is [[Lithiel]]'s idol, a man who courageously stood against the world and supported the liberty of Alderwyl - standing against [[Dragons]], [[Dawnborn]], and all others who dared to evoke their tyranny on her land and people. (Lithiel believes the Dragons were always like they are now after the [[Rage of Dragons]], and thus might not understand that they were not always monsters.)

[[King Lysandre's Blade]] is supposedly in the Whisperwood.
