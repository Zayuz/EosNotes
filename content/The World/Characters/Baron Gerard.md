He recognized our potential as a group after we stopped a ghost pirate invasion and tasked us with slaying [[Freyalise|Freyalise's]] local wraith commander to protect his city. He works with [[Aurian]], and has promised to pledge his allegiance to him if he finds the [[Numinos]] for him. He thought this Numinos was in the [[Wraith Wilds]] for some reason.

Baron Gerard has jewellery connections in [[Ark]], which he is allowing [[Lithiel]] to take advantage of thanks to her donation of a [[Valuren Transcontinental War Facility#Loot|Valuren Mech]] (originally piloted by Garius) with two batteries that is capable of massive destruction and chaos.
