One of [[Malphas]]'s inner circle, specifically the Hand of Malphas. She is a paladin with exceptional strength, at least some of which is obtained through the use of giant's strength potions. She has a quirk where she tosses badgers and other wildlife that she finds. She encountered the party when she was charged to watch over the group by Malphas, which she begrudgingly accepted.

Tassia is 332 years old.

Tassia is perfectly honourable and honest, straight-edge and good-hearted. She is thus a terrible liar.

She has had a romantic history with Malphas in the past, before he was wounded and donned the mask.

Tassia noted reflexively when [[Toth]]'s corruption was discovered that she is tired of war, which surprised [[Lithiel]] who has spent her entire life psyching herself up for one.

She died during the [[Battle of Charrum Vale]], and was subsequently revived by Malphas.

##### Denied Inodan
Tassia and Rose approach the portal to [[Inodan]], where 50(ish) honour guard appear to escort them. Their radiant armour depicts angels in flight/combat. Malphas is impatient, and he tells Tassia that she is reassigned to broker a peace in [[Chyris]] instead of entering to fulfil one of her lifelong dreams of visiting the seat of the pantheon. 
He warns [[Rose]] to keep her bow close, and then is heard arguing with Tassia as Rose enters. Tassia punched Malphas in the face, and insisted on keeping her current task. This bent his mask until [[Amelia]] mended it.
