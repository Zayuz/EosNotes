A fiend and embodiment of greed, who offers contracts and deals of escalating cost to desperate souls before eventually consuming them. He appears whenever a willing soul prays by the riverside, projecting an avatar to meet them there. His companion, a great crab called Gertrude, carries his wares. Supposedly, Scrimshaw knows all that happens beneath the oceans of the world. He has demonstrated a distaste for Shadows, tasking the party with destroying one near Merrowhome. 

Scrimshaw appears as a large catfish fiend, often humble despite his riches. However, his true form beneath the oceans appears more business-like. He had amassed a huge horde of items and wealth, which was unfortunately destroyed after his untimely death.

When Scrimshaw tasked us with defeating the Shadow lurking in the [[Valuren Transcontinental War Facility]], he also provided [[Florian]] with a contract such that anything he killed would have their soul consumed by him. Florian got the killing blow on the Shadow, which drove Scrimshaw to madness via possession. It was the unfortunate scenario that we had to turn his Merrow against him and slay him following this. During this fight, Scrimshaw's tongue AOE was the first attack to have hit Lithiel during the campaign. Notably, he would heal for each opponent struck, making a low numbers, high dex team ideal for dealing with him. When he died, he vanished into a puddle that consumed all his treasure.

[[Florian]] managed to wiggle his way out of a soul contract with Scrimshaw after being lured in by the promise of seeing [[Florian's Father|his father]] again, providing the fiend with his first outwitting in all his many lives.
