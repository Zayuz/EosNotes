The God of Devotion, whose aspects include order, zeal, and solidarity. He is the guardian of [[Vyn]], using his [[Holy Order]] to keep peace and order across the world. 

Malphas is the deity who rules the known world from [[Ark]], and who discovered us after we activated the beacon in [[New Dothulgrad]]. He spared our lives, and trusted us after asking what made us worth keeping alive. Since then he has remained in rather close contact, correctly guessing that [[Rose]] was a [[Prophet]] of the [[High Ones]]. He has invested in her safety and success hoping that she can avert the coming cleansing.

He sealed away Toth when he attempted to feast upon the Luminos 400 years ago, using [[Toth#Feasting Upon the Luminos|a certain 10th level protection spell]] thousands of times.

Malphas's inner circle consists of X individuals of exceptional power and worldly insight. They have never died and been replaced due him granting them immortality and raising them from the dead when they perish in battle. This also implies that they have never turned against him or retired of their own volition, and they seem exceptionally devout.

Members include:
[[Tassia]], Hand of Malphas
Grandmaster Caradrin Arantheal
