The Goddess of Light, whose domains also include Peace and Solidarity. She is the leader of the [[Dawnborn]] pantheon of Gods. She has been absent from the world for a long time while attending to the wound in reality deep within [[Inodan#The Heart of Inodan|Inodan]]. In her absence, the world's state has slowly decayed and she attributes this to her lack of presence personally in [[Rose goes to Inodan]]. 

Her form within Inodan is that of a large [[Radiants|Radiant]].

She alludes that her six artefacts, if collected entirely, have some sort of power that will allow her to return to the world without sacrificing her duties. They include:
Chalice - 
Bow - Wolf Mother
Blade - Halaman
Drape - Blood Elves of Kyris
Horn - Razelighter
Pendant - Lithiel

Rose mentions the divine guardian, and the bishop mentions that they are excavating them but it will take too long. ORIS. This is big news that their goddess may come back! Rumours for more than a decade that the circlet sits upon the brow of the Dragon Empress. They do not know the others. Secure the divine guardian and use it against the dragons... Mungi thinks the chalice is owned by the Golden Queen of Sediim. Circlet = Vyn. Chalice = Sediim. Pendant = Alderwyl.
