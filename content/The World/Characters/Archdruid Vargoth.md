Beneath the Twinslove Woods the Archdruid Vargoth has sacrificed his physical form to summon [[Merrenoloths]] to soothe the anger of the [[Gnolls]] afflicted with [[Red Madness]]. The source of the corruption is supposedly an [[Toth#Feasting Upon the Luminos|ancient seal]] from the [[War of Dawn and Dusk]], whose path no prior archdruid has ever returned from. 

Granted the party permission to use the [[Staff of Vargoth]], which he seems not to have known was cursed and advised we did not use it in its present state. Also granted the party quick access to the depths below, a direct passage to [[Bral]].
