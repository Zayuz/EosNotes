*Secondborn of the Dark, Incarnate of Wrath, Father of Corruption, The First Traitor*

His cult is the [[Cult of the Rook]].

The Incarnate of Hate and corruption, who takes the form of an all consuming ooze. He is known to be sealed under the [[Whisperwood]], but his corruption persists faintly across all the forests of [[Duskwind Map.png|Alderwyl]].  He was not imprisoned in the same way as the others, instead his spirit was sundered and bound _inside_ the [[Whisperwood]], where he remains as a source of natural corruption and desiccation within Alderwyl's wild places. His physical form was caught in Malphas's spell, but partially free. This allowed him to permeate to other places despite being sealed away. 

When we confronted him in his lair, his core was that of a huge black heart of darkness.

Lithiel was told by Toth that they should bow to her - which she refused, claiming that she would not be so easily corrupted
All that you have accomplished, all that you have won... Yet still you lick the boots of kings.
