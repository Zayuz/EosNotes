The first of [[Alderwyl]]'s incarnates to be locked away during the [[War of Dawn and Dusk]]. He was sealed deep in the [[Dread Vault]] below [[Lathyrus Palace]], which [[Malphas]] saw to personally.. He is responsible for the souls of the dead becoming wraiths in Alderwyl and claims the beautiful [[Freyalise]] as her champion. His champions are known as 'Lich Kings/Queens', and raise the dead as wraiths to do their bidding. This process if terrible for the souls of the deceased, and the [[Deathseekers]] take significant issue with it. It is suggested that it is through the soul of his Lich Queen that he was able to allow his power to leak out, and would eventually become fully free.

[[Lithiel]] signed a contract with Urthemiel through [[Scrimshaw]], becoming his Lich Queen and uncursing her tome that she claimed from Freyalise. The soul-deal will end when Urthemiel enters the world again and all the other Incarnates are dead.
