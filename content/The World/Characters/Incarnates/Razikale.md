An [[Incarnates|Incarnate]] affiliated with obsession and sex, whose influence was masked after the fall of [[Lathyrus]]. It is possible that she spent this time in her realm, known as the [[Malefic Palace]]. Until its illusion is dispelled, it appeared as a gorgeous vision of [[Lathyrus]] called the [[Beatific Palace]]. To get in, one must approach her mirror with the appropriate blessing bestowed by Razikale herself. 

She is rumoured to have been corrupting [[King Lysandre]] into taking the drastic actions he did, which we later confirmed through Ourea. Her champion was [[Vora]], Lithiel's mother. This is in line with her favourite theme - encouraging cycles of debauchery and madness that lead to ruin.

She has an active following in the [[Wraith Wilds]] known as the [[Cult of the Mirror]]. They reside in [[Paradyse]], where [[Lithiel]] was born and raised.

She appeared once during a dream to Lithiel as a grey-skinned orc while Lithiel was drunk.
She speaks with pleasant flattery, and coaxes Lithiel into continuing her quest to destroy Freyalise and Toth. Her descriptions on Toth's demise are vivid, and she tells Lithiel to seek him out at the source (one of his temples) to do the most damage.

Additionally, she confirmed that Lithiel's mother is very intelligent and was successful in her ritual to invoke her through Lithiel's birth.

Sometimes she speaks in Lithiel's mind during combat - the first instance of which was when she fought [[Wrath-Eye]], who was infected with Toth's corruption. "Yes, hit him again!"
