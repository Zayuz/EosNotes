An [[Incarnates|Incarnate]] affiliated with obsession and sex, whose influence vanished from the world after the fall of [[Lathyrus]]. She is rumoured to have been corrupting [[King Lysandre]] into taking the drastic actions he did.

She has an active following in the [[Wraith Wilds]] known as the [[Cult of the Mirror]]. 

When Lithiel was drunk, she forced a sleeping trance and entered her dreams:
The two appear in a courtyard, Razikale taking the form of a grey-skinned half orc with blue markings.
She speaks with pleasant flattery, and coaxes Lithiel into continuing her quest to destroy Freyalise and Toth. Her descriptions on Toth's demise are vivid, and she tells Lithiel to seek him out at the source (one of his temples) to do the most damage.

Additionally, she confirmed that Lithiel's mother is very intelligent and was successful in her ritual to invoke her through Lithiel's birth.

Sometimes she speaks in Lithiel's mind during combat - the first instance of which was when she fought [[Wrath-Eye]], who was infected with Toth's corruption. "Yes, hit him again!"
