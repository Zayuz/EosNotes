Once a friendly dragon that worked alongside an uncorrupted [[King Lysandre]] and [[Reihan]], he had a dragonborn form and was not always host to an incarnate within him. He was king of the [[Dragon Empire]], which owned all of [[Alderwyl]] before they allowed some space for mortals to make their homes.

The people of Alderwyl attribute the [[Rage of Dragons]] to Lusacan's influence somehow.

After he was freed by [[Nagasha]] using [[Rose]], he flew west.

Lusacan was the strongest incarnate and the first to be imprisoned (not entirely true)? He could drink light, and is the most difficult to contain. He can swallow the light of Lithiel's wish because Oris got her power from the Luminos as well.
