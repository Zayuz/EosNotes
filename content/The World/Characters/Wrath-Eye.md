Decatriarch Wrath-Eye was the leader of the [[Gnolls]], lieutenant of [[Freyalise]], and bearer of [[Toth]]'s wicked power. She was phenomenally difficult to take down, and only through the combined might of our party, [[Aurian]], [[Leanna]], and [[Tassia]] were we able to punch through her three captains and take her down. She transformed into a hulking manifestation of the forest's corruption before death.

Her fellow leaders included:
A permanently invisible gnoll with a bow and a knife, who loved poison.
A gnoll with a massive tri-flail that each inflicted a different effect.
[[Trick-Totem]], a gnoll that scattered totems with random effects. They include healing, mind control, and blasting. They are extremely potent and have huge ranges. While the other gnoll captains died as they were taken by [[Red Madness]], Trick only pretended to be taken via an illusion spell and turned on his former allies in the end to help us.
