A female druid of [[Charrum Vale]]'s Peak can see the past and the future, has a familiar named Tealeaf. Tealeaf is a wolf.
Bid us collect a (female Chirission) lion (flame variant) from Lion's Arch that we never delivered, seems friendly to us. 

(Personal observation) Has many similarities to [[Shugo]], goddess of the wilderness.
Wolves in both pictures, powerful storms that drain crazy amounts of Exhaustion, seemingly immortal and capable of easily viewing the distant past and future 'it's all in how you look' she claims. Powerful, caring of animals and knows some crazy rituals with them, doesn't directly commit to secular causes. Has a cleric(?) [[Faye]].
