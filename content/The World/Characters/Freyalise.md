An incredibly attractive, immortal elven sorceress who considers herself the 'First Necromancer' due to her unique art of binding souls forcefully to her will and commanding them like puppets in the form of [[Wraiths]]. She has claimed the former empire of [[Lathyrus]] as her demesne, and her ascension to power happened after the fall of [[King Lysandre]], preventing the [[Holy Order]] and the [[Dragon Empire]] from claiming dominion over the continent.

We have known her to summon colossal undead dragons known as Leviathans to her side, and interrupted a ritual to raise one early into our adventures in Duskwind.

Freyalise considered herself the legal heir to Alderwyl.
