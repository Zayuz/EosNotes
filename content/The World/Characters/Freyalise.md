An incredibly attractive, immortal elven sorceress who considers herself the 'First Necromancer' due to her unique art of binding souls forcefully to her will and commanding them like puppets in the form of [[Wraiths]]. She has claimed the former empire of [[Lathyrus]] as her demesne, and her ascension to power happened after the fall of [[King Lysandre]], preventing the [[Holy Order]] and the [[Dragon Empire]] from claiming dominion over the continent.

Freyalise considered herself the legal heir to Alderwyl. When asked to explain this, she seemed to suggest right of conquest.

She uses [[Urthemiel]]'s magic to corrupt angels like [[Vyra]] and twists them into her undead servants.
