The grandmother of [[Leanna]] and the greatest [[Deathseekers|Deathseeker]] to have served under [[Arazeal]], she had [[Lusacan]] as her companion and friend and kept the company of [[King Lysandre]] before they fell to corruption through the [[Rage of Dragons]] and the Fall of [[Lathyrus]]. She was also friendly with [[Ourea]].


#### Memories
Shiloh must collect the four pieces of Reihan's soul - sundered upon her death by Lusacan - to unlock his skill tree.

The Eerie is a massive tower that the wish restored, and is where the angels used to stay. It has a sky jail like the one in game of thrones. Time slow effect? Ghosts of Reihan (katana), Lysandre, and a red scaled dragonborn with a mane of fur down his back in a big cloak. They overlook Lathyrus, it is thriving. There be people and friendly dragons everywhere. 
Dragonborn: 'its a shame, I half expected this to be a fun reunion'
Rei: 'Yes, well... At least we have each other.'
Lysandre: 'Well, if this is to be our last meeting for the foreseeable future lets make the most of it. Who wants to go sky racing?'
They agree and dragonborn becomes a huge dragon (size - ancient+)
Lysandre sprouts angel wings (aasimar), and Reihan's sword etching of a Pegasus becomes a mount for her to fly.

Another memory of Reihan: Reihan stands in front of the gateway to the sepulchre conversing with the ghost of Reihan's mother. Reihan is crying, and Arazeal puts his arm around her. She 'didnt think it would happen to me.' The ghost is pulled into the gate, and vanishes. Her mother was killed during the rage of dragons.
