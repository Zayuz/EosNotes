We found a baby [[Kvarotz Dragons|Kvarotz]] dragon in the spooky ghost pirate fortress outside of [[Deepside Market]], leading to the [[Valuren Transcontinental War Facility|Valuren Transcontinental War Facility.]] He was to be sacrificed to raise a massive undead dragon. Florian has kept him since, and after many sessions of keeping him in the backpack he is going to be raised in [[Charrum Vale]] with [[Aurian]].
