A gnoll that scatters totems with random effects. They include healing, mind control, and blasting. They are extremely potent and have huge ranges. While the other gnoll captains died as they were taken by [[Red Madness]], Trick only pretended to be taken via an illusion spell and turned on his former allies in the end to help us.

He is the leader of the gnolls that were beneath [[Twinslove]] after we defeated [[Wrath-Eye]], and he intends to take them to new lands.
