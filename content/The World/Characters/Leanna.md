A [[Deathseekers|Deathseeker]] that serves alongside [[Shiloh]], and who happens to be descended from the legendary [[Reihan]]. She is pragmatic and careful, and uses two pistols that shoot light in combat. She had a crush on him for many years, but Shiloh was too oblivious to understand she was flirting with him. [[Lithiel]] played wingman, pushing her own attraction to Leanna aside to help her get with him and they have been steady since. She has significant moral reservations about Lithiel's actions and motives, and the two have been known to fight from time to time.

Leanna has died twice in combat, suffering some bad luck at the hands of our enemies. Thankfully, Lithiel has saved her both times: the first with the revivify spell (the only time she will ever be able to cast it), and the second time via the soulstone necklace she commissioned.
