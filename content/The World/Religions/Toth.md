The Incarnate of Hate and corruption, who takes the form of an all consuming ooze. He is known to be sealed under the [[Whisperwood]], but his corruption persists faintly across all the forests of [[Duskwind Map.png|Alderwyl]].

### Feasting Upon the Luminos
While reaching for the light of the [[Luminos]] through the roots of the [[Twinslove]] Woods, he was prevented from reaching it in some manner by [[Malphas]], causing him to be trapped. To do so, Malphas used thousands of tenth level protection spells featuring the following rune, which originally glowed RED BLACK BLUE PURPLE YELLOW ORANGE GREEN. However, since we severed a root connecting to the shield wall, green has vanished and Toph seems to be liberated in some way. The spell seems to vastly increase the caster's AC in the same way that shield does, and disintegrates any material object on contact with it.
