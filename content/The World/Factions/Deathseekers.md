An organization of [[Arazeal]]'s faithful, who devote themselves to slaying undead and returning their souls to their right place in the afterlife. They reside in northern [[Alderwyl]], above [[Lathyrus]] in a base known as [[Death's Vigil]].

Known Deathseekers include [[Shiloh]] and [[Leanna]].

The Deathseeker Sanctum is a place under Death's Vigil where the Deathseekers store their most valuable arms and armor. Equipment that belongs to the order of Lightseekers, which was abolished for reasons unclear to us after the War of Dawn and Dusk.
Vault beneath the Deathseeker sanctum - arms/wealth/armour, all have Azazael's crest and made of white metal inlaid with gold. Ancient armaments of the Lightseekers, not used since the war of dawn and dusk.

New mission for Shiloh! The last second (Reihan) perished in the war of Dawn and Dusk, and her soul was shattered. To truly take her place, get all the pieces of her soul to transfer the powers to Shiloh.

Amiren told us that the Numen learned runic magic from the Ancients, and this seems to be related to how the Dawnborn invoke their blessings?

Apparently the Light seekers served the Dawnborn more directly, and then became the Deathseekers for an unknown reason.
