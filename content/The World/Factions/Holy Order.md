A military run by [[Malphas]] for the preservation of mortal life. They frequently combat [[Shadow]], hunt [[Wild Mages]], and quell unrest. They are based primary in [[Vyn]], but their influence spans the globe.

The holy order requires children with magical talent to be registered by age 8, who are then typically inducted into the order as priests and enforcers while others *disappear.*

### Doctrine
Before creation itself, there was the Luminos, a being of such divine grace that its very existence shone the only light in the cosmos. The embodiment of primordial light
However, the Luminos grew sick, or weary, or was struck by some malady, and it died.
Its body created the very world we now stand upon, and though its light faded, giving rise to the time of dusk, it has since risen from death three times, or perhaps, has taken three dying breaths. Each breath shone light across the world that allowed life to flourish. But the light was fleeting, and in time it would fade. For the Luminos is a being of such a high plane of existence that each of its ragged breaths is a hundred mortal lifespans.
Each of its breath gives rise to an Age, the first breath, the second breath, and the third
At the dawn of the second age, the Dawnborn appeared from the darkness and found a way to harness the Luminos's light and keep life alive.
Skriath, clever and warm, and Oris, loyal and kind, combined their might, channelling the second breath of the Luminos into a concentrated sphere
This sphere became the sun, and gave rise to the first daytime.
But the dark is older than the light, and its strength just as divine. And so, night exists, a time when shadow once more covers the land and beings of dusk slip through the cracks and terrorize the land.
But surely, the sun rises again each day, keeping the dawn alive.
Alas, philosophy aside, time is measured by the fleeting breaths of the Luminos.
Once it breathes its last, and there is no more Light to come, it is unclear what will happen.
'will it die?'
It will, inevitably
Each breath is shorter than the last
And the Luminos is dying
The only question is when.
