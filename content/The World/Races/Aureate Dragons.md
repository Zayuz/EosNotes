Translates to Wardscale

The metallic scaled Aureate dragons were once respected as the wisest and most magically adept of their kind. However, after the rise of [[Nagasha||Nagasha's]] [[Dragon Empire]], the Wardscale refused to join, and were all but obliterated in a conflict that saw their home reduced to a smouldering waste. It is unclear how many, if any, of the Aureate survived the attack. Their scales were said to have been many different shades of metallic, and they could resist magical effects, deflecting them back at their casters. Their sire was Auriga, the Dawnwrought.

The most famous Aureate dragon we know is [[Aurian]], though he seems to only be a dragonborn and not a full dragon.

Their home was once the [[Slag Flats]], until they were hunted to extinction by the other dragons.
