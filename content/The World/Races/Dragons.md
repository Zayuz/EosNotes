Originating from Alderwyl long before mortals inhabited it, Dragons each come from one of many broods and their associated founders.
All dragons have a glamour form, in which they can appear as a humanoid for the purpose of fitting in buildings, infiltrating, and other things.

There are many broods of dragons:
[[Exorum Dragons]] (Stonetail)
[[Ravkka Dragons]] (Frostbrood)
[[Kvarotz Dragons]] (Moltenmaw)
[[Aureate Dragons]] (Wardscale)
[[Natolan Dragons]] (Needlefang)
[[Viperidax Dragons]] (Vilebrood)
