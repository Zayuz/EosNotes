Translates to Frostbrood

The Ravkka are elusive, swift, and without mercy. The air shrieks as wind runs through the rime on their perpetually frozen bodies. They blitz in and out of combat, treating flying like a graceful aerial dance. The Ravkka make up many of [[Nagasha]]â€™s elite forces, serving as infiltrators and assassins working behind the scenes in the war against the[[ Holy Order]]. Their sire is [[Rehsyra]], the Winged Verglas.

Indeed, the Ravkka were the first brood to pledge themselves to Nagasha.

They seem to inhabit [[Norgard]], between the [[Deathseekers]] hideout and the fallen kingdom of [[Lathyrus]].
