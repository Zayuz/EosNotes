The Shadow that Speaks, a voiced Shadow from the [[Valuren Transcontinental War Facility]]:
Believes in fight and survival, drowning themes and darkness
The High ones see this fall, free of chains, limitless potential, domination unbound 

> "The high ones have turned countless worlds upside down. Yours will be no different. Stay and die, leave and die, it will make no difference."


Every third full moon Shadows appear
Maybe another plane?
Apostates transform
Shadows aren't mindless - specific locations produce commanders and intelligent ones
(Five locations)


Are the duskborn making the shadows? No, but they are related. We believe the shadows to be manifestations of magic itself that are undoubtedly connected to the high ones. Duskborn are magically overexposed, maybe connected if magic comes from the high ones. (Malphas)
