Translates to Stonetail

We found and hunted down an Exorum Dragon in session 1, it burned [[Icelia]] and [[Victor]] from 100 to 0. We then hunted it down with [[Aurian]] and got them in their sleep. Its body dissolved except for the parts we harvested.

The Exorum are the most numerous of Dragonkind since the Rage of Dragons, and they make up the bulk of the Dragon Empire’s forces, both in terms of their true-blooded dragons, as well as kobolds, dragonborn, and other draconian subspecies. The Exorum are most noted for their stone-like (or in rare cases genuine stone) carapace that adorns their body. They fly notably slower than other dragons, but make up for it in their ability to burrow and ambush their prey, moving unnaturally silently through the earth. Their sire is Kraktanbor, the Earth’s Fury.

The Exorum have three quite famous and terrifying individuals to boast:
[[Charrum]], [[Kraktanbor]], and [[Razelighter]].
