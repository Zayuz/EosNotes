According to the ruins of their civilization just outside of Ark... The Valurens had a society of poets and warriors, of great technology and magic. They based this technology on a civilization that came before themselves. Supposedly they had discovered within these ruins a device that they then replicated. A device that brought prosperity to their people(?). This device never captured the full scope of the original as they were missing (obscured). Most likely this is referring to the Numinos, and the device being the Beacon in [[New Dothulgrad]].
