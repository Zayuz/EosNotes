A Prophet is a character connected to the [[High Ones]], who takes the place of a deceased individual with their memories and identity yet is not them. According to [[Malphas]], they are notoriously hard to kill and he does not look forward to their arrival. In fact, all other Prophets have been eliminated by Malphas as part of the reason for the [[Holy Order]]'s pursuit against magic. This is because all Prophets have magical talent, and thus this way they are caught with the widest net.

From [[Rose]]'s experience, Prophets are plagued by horrifying visions and visitations from the [[High Ones]]. 

[[Cormac]] knows a surprisingly amount about the Prophet and her nightmares!
He mentions three that he is aware of:
The Rebellion was investigated for the presence of a Prophet, which are currently suspected to be false.
Leader of the Church of the Holy Order is known as a True Prophet. May or may not be the same as Rose.
Quote above by Malphas about Prophets not being something he enjoys encountering.

The temple of the Prophet Althaxis may be connected to [[Prophet]]s, in territory of the Wolf Mother.

### Visions
##### Vision 1
On the first night of the campaign, [[Icelia]] and [[Rose]] saw a tower with a maelstrom above it, and heard lots of screams.
We rolled Lumineth Die on Night 2 during normal travel, result 4. Unknown result.

##### Vision 2
The second vision is one of [[Ark]], where we see the [[Sun Temple]] and then the statue of Malphas within it. It is struck by lightning and explodes. The temple ignites in flame surrounding it.

##### Vision 3
The same day holds more visions, this time only for [[Rose]] and related to her nature as a [[Prophet]]:
Rose sees her home of [[Ark]] when she looks out the window. (Triggered by Horton hooting at the window.) Her mother calls her real name. She's... In her house, summed on breakfast. 'Big night don't forget.' Rose remembers that she was supposed to meet the grand inquisitor that night to have her magical talent graded (14 years old). She awakens in her bed shortly after, getting some time to explore for a few minutes before that.

A candle holder with a yellow-gold coloured orb, which is specifically not a control sphere and happens to be involved in her magical aptitude test. A magical focus of sorts? Her mother claims that it is older than control sphere, a tool used by the first civilization with the capacity to CURE ARCANE FEVER.

##### Vision 4
Rose is later with her father in the woods, who is chopping wood. He tells her to cook in order to help her mother, but when she tries the dream resets. The atmosphere grows more ominous when Rose says she cant go inside. Her father claims she burned her family alive, and starts to yell and grow violent. The whole thing feels very evil!

Later, upon confessing these visions to Malphas he mentions that 'another prophet has been chosen.'

##### Vision 5
Cormac did a test with Rose to see what they could discern from her visions. It involved knocking her out.
Rose is in her bed at home. She is young. Nobody is home. The orb is with her. She touches it, and her father tells her from behind she is not ready. She lets go and turns, and sees his ghost shining with pale yellow light. "Is this form not pleasing to you?" It transforms into her bird. "I have no form. I am the way of the tide or the wind. We have no names. You came seeking us. Seeking answers." Rose asks why she is the prophet and what it means. "We have heard your cries for help, and soon we will answer." It picks up the orb. "The time is not yet. Things have been set in motion, but they are not finished. You must finish them." Two more appear when Rose asks about the beacon. They all take animal forms (Bear, spider, wolf). "Allow things to develop. You will know when you are ready." Not the same as prequel light. "Many have tried to stop the events, you will not be the first nor the last." They show the past. "The same events that unfold each time. It is the purpose of humanity." Many factors change the appointed time, and they do not answer when asked how to avert it. "Follow your path. Malphas's Golden Path." It turns into Rose and then starts its horrors again, apologizing for the fires when she picks up the orb. 

Is the fire an analogy for the red madness we unleashed? Got the first one before we activated the beacon...

##### Vision 6
Rose is in Ark, which has an eerie feel to it. She explores the Sun Temple, and sees the high ones, who won’t speak to her. Outside, the statue of Malphas is toppled. She sees herself gathered with the Grand Master and others at the statue, a crew dismantling it. It is a scene of chaos and war with Shadows within the city walls and an army of normal mortals attacking from the outside. The attackers bear red, green, and gold banners. In the crowd attacking the walls, Rose sees a Minotaur (Glinthorn, second in command) who seems to be their siege leader who bears the same colours - the flag of the Rebellion. Back at the statue, Rose notices something in her time-stopped self’s hand - the golden ball from her previous dream, which Ryan theorized to be the Numinos. She can now tell its engravings are the same as those on the runestones of the Numen. She asks the high ones to let her see what happens next, and before she is pulled from her dream, time starts briefly. She sees her peers dismantling the statue to reveal a beacon beneath it. Then, Tassia runs towards them with Lithiel chasing her. One of them is yelling “stop!”, but it is unclear which.
