Undead tend to be those that refuse to pass on for one reason or another. But wraiths are souls ripped from the afterlife directly and bound to the will of a necromancer. Can be taken from even a living target, leaving the body alive but the wraith obedient. They are direct controlled slave-ghosts. Once a wraith has been created, that soul can no longer find peace. Originated after the fall of [[Lathyrus]] by the alluring [[Freyalise]]. Wraiths will return over and over until slain in proximity to a [[Deathseekers|Deathseeker]], who moves the soul directly to the afterlife via [[Arazeal]]'s divine magic.
