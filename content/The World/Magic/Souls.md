All creatures have souls, which can appear as different colours when made visible by magic.
[[Shadow]]s damage souls with their attacks, and [[Icelia]] speculates that [[Red Madness]] causes soul corruption which eventually results in transformation into a shadow themselves. Hence, [[Wild Mages]] can be called 'soul burners' as they destroy their soul in exchange for magical power.

[[Holy Order]] specialists can repair souls damaged by [[Shadow]]. They do so in holy places usually, but otherwise they can do impromptu rituals... The process involves undressing, putting the hands out, and then the healer making an extraction motion with both hands. Mist appears that twirls around the finger, and can then be pulled like thread. The other hand uses radiant light magic and soothes the soul thread - damage from shadow appears as visible gashes which the ritual mends in a very delicate process. Takes about two hours when done right. Any damage can destroy the soul. Ambrosia is needed after for both parties.

[[Tassia]] can conduct this ritual.
