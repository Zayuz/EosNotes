Four large islands with several smaller ones around and between them in the [[Unseen Sea]], south of [[Alderwyl]]. Due to ancient contamination, the islands are uninhabitable. However, the [[Rathi Orcs]] do not care about the low habitability and live there anyways. 

The [[Dawnborn]] [[Darimach]] is supposed to be the one leading these isles, but he takes no role in governance or society.
