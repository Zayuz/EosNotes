An isolated location in an unknown ocean location on [[Eos]], whose small island features walls around it that reach up above the atmosphere such that only starships or magic can reach the location. It is a city-state governed by [[Oris]]. 

Inodan is patrolled by imposing honour guard of the [[Holy Order]], who may or may not still be sentient people. Personally, I think that they are no longer possessing free will if they were ever mortals at all. Their obedience and orderliness is absolute.

The CARD for Inodan suggests that it can make creatures into Gods.
Oris's statue here has wings, which is different from her representation in [[Ark]].
Constructs called [[Radiants]] reside in Inodan, they are very strange.

The [[Dawnborn]] have a theatre-like room in which they receive mortal guests, but it is rarely if ever used.

Behind the theatre, Oris and the [[Radiants]] guard a wound in reality that the [[High Ones]]'s influence seem to come from. Here, [[Rose]] experienced clearer and more potent visions and recorded the exchange [[Rose goes to Inodan]]
