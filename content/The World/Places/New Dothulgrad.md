An underground [[Valuren#Facilities|Valuren facility]] between [[Lion's Arch]] and [[Ark]]. 
Contains an imitation beacon (copied from [[Old Dothulgrad]]) hidden down a river concealed by illusions. 
Stores the [[Divine Guardian]]. 
Stores a humongous [[Valuren Warship]].
Was somehow known by a Durach and the [[Eldremar Rebellion]], who hoped to take the ship for themselves...

Considering these ruins keep hide the replica beacon of [[Old Dothulgrad]] hidden beneath, the idea that the [[Valuren]] artefact they were seeking was the [[Numinos]] is all the more certain. The passage towards it is marked with a Snake carving of unknown affiliation, within which the beacon lies. The tablets around the beacon read as follows in Ancient Valuren:

>> "Oh Lords, Oh Makers, We can hear you calling. We feel your love. We know about your sacrifice. Without you, we are nothing. A twig on the currents of time, a sheep without shepherd. Free us from our vices and forgive us our trespasses. Deliver us from our pains, and bless us with your everlasting mercy." ...On and on about unworthy and need to be delivered from the sins of their civilization. Only they know the truth and can be saved... "We deliver unto you this sacrifice of lives given to the beacon that we have so faithfully recreated from old Dothulgrad. We require only the [[Numinos]]. Thank you oh High Ones for delivering us our new eternity."
>> > - The hidden beacon in New Dothulgrad


Had a [[Beacon]] replica made by the Valurens that we fired, and were subsequently shown Rose's Dream, AKA the session set in the Valuren time period where they became the Dawnborn. Garrius/The Divine Guardian as evidence of the events being true. They wiped out the planets population and became gods.
