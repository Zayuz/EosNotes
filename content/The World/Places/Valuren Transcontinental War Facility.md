### Exploration
The underwater facility goes beneath [[Merrowhome]] and had a sentient shadow lurking within that the Merrow called the Great Dark. It had war machines, and branches out to 6 locations! (Continents?) The one we took goes under [[Ark]] and has a TON of war mechs in storage. We dispelled the shadow there, then properly killed it later after it had possessed [[Scrimshaw]].

Lithiel put a glyph that will glow on command (it is invisible) over the control orb slot in the Ark mountain access to the facility so that she can track it down if she needs to. (It is a 13hr trip between Vyn/Ark and Alderwyl.)

One/two floors of the Alderwyl component of the facility produced and refined [[Soulstone]]. Lithiel took some of this material for the crafting of protective armaments for the party.

The main chamber under Alderwyl contained a Valuren Spider Mech (colossal) and a recording of Haelstrom going over their plan to preserve the world known as the [[Divinity Project]]. 


### Loot
"This is Garius's Mech Suit, if we are where I think we are..." - Shiloh after we find the Mech Suit
They claim that [[Garrius]] was an important figure, and that this is an important research facility they weren't sure was on this continent. As mysterious to them as it is to me.
