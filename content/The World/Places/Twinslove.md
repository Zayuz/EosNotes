### Overworld
A forest in the northeast of Duskwind, boasting the membership of the [[Wild Hunt]] and the Clergy of [[Cardos]] and [[Iara]]. They are the Dawnborn twins of Autumn and Spring. There is also a strong [[Gnolls||Gnoll]] and [[Fey]] presence deeper in the woods. Underground, past the gnolls there is a [[Temple of Iara]] built by the [[Archdruid Vargoth]]. Twinslove remains curiously unspoiled even since the [[Splintering]], though the twins have not been seen since the [[Apostate's War]]. Shadows seem to be the only foes that may enter the land, where dragons and undead are repelled.

[[Florian]] and [[Amelia]] are from Twinslove.

[[Lord Herne]] and [[Archdruid Felanthe]] inhabit Twinslove.

Twinslove has a runestone that allows communication with deceased ancestors, which the resident archdruid knows how to operate.


### Underworld
[[Gnolls|Gnoll]] caves twist deep beneath the earth with cave paintings from primitive times. 
[[Merrenoloths]] tend to the gnolls here, doing their best to soothe them out of their [[Red Madness]] induced rage. They were summoned by the [[Duragh||Archduragh]] bound to this forest by the name of [[Archdruid Vargoth]] from the Temple of Iara he build brick by brick, who believes that a corruption that lies beneath is responsible for the gnolls' behaviour.

Carved stones of [[Numen]] origin appear occasionally. They are marked with random lines and markings that are decidedly not text, and therefore cannot be read.
Stone obelisks like lamp posts lead the way, not lit. One metal sphere atop each. Identical to runestone in Twinslove.
Runestones were always in Twinslove. They are older than the [[Dawnborn]]. When they were shaping the world, they could not alter the runestones in ANY way.
The city of [[Bral]] exists deep beneath Twinslove.
