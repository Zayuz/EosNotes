A continent on [[Eos]] consisting of three large islands on known as [[Nursill]], [[Northforge]], and [[Kallidar]], this country remains entirely independent of [[Dawnborn]] rule. Once they were protectorates, until the [[Crimson Invasion]] destroyed the kingdoms as they were. The [[Blood Elves]] now rule the Island of Kallidar, and Orcs, Goblins, and Trolls occupy Northforge. After the invasion, the Dawnborn [[Deyma]] no longer rules the islands as she used to.
