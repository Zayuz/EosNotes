The home city of the [[Merrow]] located in the [[Slag Flats]]. It was once ruled by [[The Ocean King]], who was at some point usurped by [[Scrimshaw]]. We know that [[The Ocean King]] had a relationship of some sort with [[Kovosh]], God of Magic. Though Merrowhome was damaged by [[Scrimshaw]]'s [[Shadow]] possession, it mostly remains intact and the shadow from the [[Valuren Transcontinental War Facility]] that Merrowhome attaches to remains under [[Holy Order]] control. They have established an embassy with [[Ark]] since their cooperation in defeating [[Scrimshaw]].
