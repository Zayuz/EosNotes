The Sun Temple in Ark contains a shrine to each [[Dawnborn]] God, which the party has used to successfully communicate with them in the past. Though all Dawnborn are present, only [[Oris]] and [[Malphas]] has significant offerings. Malphas later demonstrated to us that the statues can be used to teleport to the respective realms or lair of each God, though we required him to activate them.
